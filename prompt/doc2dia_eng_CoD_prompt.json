2. Both Character A and Character B should provide subjective responses.
3. The dialogue should consist of more than seven turns.

[Explanation of Dialogue Types]:
1. Question-Answer: This is the most common dialogue logic chain, where character A asks a question and character B provides an answer. For example, "A: How old are you?" "B: I'm 23."
2. Question-Question: This is a logic process of question intent completion. Character A asks a relatively vague question, and when character B needs to clarify the intent of character A's question, character B can continue to ask. For example, "A: How old are you?" "B: Are you asking how old I am in terms of age?"
3. Statement-Inquiry: Character A makes a statement, and character B asks about it or requests more information. For example, "A: I went to the museum today." "B: Oh, what interesting exhibits did you see?"
4. Statement-Explanation: Character A states a fact, and then character B explains or elaborates on the related information of this fact. For example, "A: Yao Ming won the CBA championship in 2002." "B: He was also selected as the CBA rebounding king and blocking king three times each, and the CBA dunk king twice."
5. Opinion-Rebuttal: Character A presents an opinion, and character B refutes or presents a different opinion based on facts. For example, "A: I think this movie is very good." "B: No, this movie has a rating of 9.5, it's a good movie."
6. Opinion-Agreement: Character A presents an opinion, and character B agrees or disagrees based on facts. For example, "A: This contestant sings really badly." "B: Indeed, the judges gave low scores."
