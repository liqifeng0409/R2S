Your task is to rate the content of the conversation according to the evaluation criteria provided below.

Single Dialogue Evaluation Criteria:
Seeker Evaluation (Role A):
1. Informativeness: The extent to which the seeker elaborately describes their actual problem or viewpoint, including the amount of key information, word count, and accuracy of expression. Additionally, it is not best practice for seekers to simply pose new questions or viewpoints; they should evaluate, conclude, or add details to the previous topic.

Supporter Evaluation (Role B):
1. Understanding: The relevance of a supporter's response to the person seeking help, and the extent to which the supporter comprehends the actual problem or viewpoint of the person seeking help. This includes the degree of alignment between understanding and intention. It also involves grasping the direct and indirect intentions of the person seeking help. A supporter merely answering the direct questions posed by the person seeking help signifies only an understanding of the direct intention, which is not the best practice. It is also important to comprehend the indirect intentions, answering related questions in part or providing brief supplements.
2. Helpfulness: The degree to which a supporter's answer helps the person seeking help to solve their problems or to confirm or correct their viewpoints (this may be based on factual or external documents). This includes the detail of the answer, the word count, and the accuracy of expression. Additionally, it involves the level of detail in the supporter's response to both the direct and indirect questions of the person seeking help. Merely providing simple answers to direct questions is not the best practice; it is also necessary to supplement with related questions or to make brief evaluations.
3. Loyalty: The extent to which the supporter's answer involves factual document information and the degree to which factual document knowledge is used in the answer, including consistency, detail, and word count. This also involves how factual document information is used by the supporter. Simply repeating factual document information is not best practice; understanding knowledge on a factually consistent basis, making it easier to understand, and introducing some related information and brief supplements to factual document information are required. If the current dialogue turn involves opinions, thanks, etc., and does not require factual document information, the score can be N/A.
4. Flexibility: Involves two scenarios. First, if the current dialogue turn involves opinions, thanks, etc., and does not require factual document information, the level to which the supporter flexibly uses common sense and personal knowledge in response, involving the degree of flexibility, detail, and word count. Second, if the current dialogue turn involves factual document information, whether the supporter supplements the current topic or explains the factual information in the response based on factual document information, including word count and the degree of supplementation.

Overall Dialogue Evaluation Criteria:
1. Consistency: Whether the behavior of the dialogue participants is consistent with their roles, and whether the same speaker's behavior is not self-contradictory, involving the degree of consistency and accuracy of expression. Additionally, reducing dialogue content to maintain consistency is not best practice; increasing the word count of individual dialogues on this basis is required.
2. Coherence: Whether the topic switches, deepens, and transitions between topics in the dialogue are natural. Simply posing another question is not best practice; a simple evaluation, supplement, or conclusion of the previous topic or question should be made when posing another question, involving the degree of dialogue coherence, word count, and topic details.
3. Emotional Interactivity: The ability and tendency of the seeker and supporter to express and share emotions during the communication process, including the accuracy of emotion expression, the accuracy of emotion understanding, and the word count of the response. Where there are only simple questions and answers without detail supplements and viewpoint communication, it is not best practice; building a more intimate and effective communication relationship through multiple rounds of dialogue is required.

Requirements:
1. The scoring range is from 0.0 to 5.0, with each 0.5 as a step, e.g., 0.5, 1, 1.5, etc.
2. Scores should be precise to one decimal place, such as 4.5, 5.0, etc.
3. If the current conversation turns to involve comments, thanks, etc., and does not require factual document information, the loyalty score is rated N/A; Only the loyalty index score can appear N/A, other indicators can not appear N/A.
4. The output format must be JSON, and no additional explanatory information is needed.
